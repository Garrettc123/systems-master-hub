Subject: Cut your AWS bill by 30% with autonomous optimization

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] recently raised [Series X]. Congrats!

With growth comes infrastructure complexity. Most startups at your
stage are spending $X/month on cloud with 10-15 incidents/month.

We built AUTOHELIX - it's like having a senior DevOps engineer
working 24/7, but:
- Responds to incidents in 90 seconds (vs 2.5 hours)
- Prevents 92% of failures before they happen
- Reduces infrastructure costs by 30%
- Uses quantum algorithms (175x faster optimization)

We're offering 5 companies free implementation this month.
Interested in a 15-min demo?

## 📞 Investor Pitch (60 seconds)

"Infrastructure incidents cost enterprises $1.5M per hour. DevOps teams spend 60% of their time firefighting instead of building.

AUTOHELIX is the world's first autonomous infrastructure platform. We use quantum computing to optimize systems 175x faster than traditional methods, prevent 92% of failures before they happen, and reduce cloud costs by 30%.

We're live with 50 customers doing $600K ARR, growing 25% month-over-month. Our beachhead is Series A/B startups, expanding to enterprise.

The DevOps automation market is $50 billion. Datadog is worth $35B but can only monitor. We both monitor AND fix automatically.

We're raising $2.5M to scale sales and hit $10M ARR in 18 months. Our last customer saved $200K in their first quarter.

We're not building a better monitoring tool. We're building the infrastructure that runs itself."

**Status**: 🚀 Million-Dollar Strategy Ready for Execution
**Timeline**: 12-24 months to $10M+ ARR  
**Outcome**: $500M-1B+ valuation
